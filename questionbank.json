There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n\nI can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.\u00a0\nX can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.\u00a0\nC can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n\nGiven an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.\nExample 1:\nInput:\u00a03\nOutput: \"III\"\nExample 2:\nInput:\u00a04\nOutput: \"IV\"\nExample 3:\nInput:\u00a09\nOutput: \"IX\"\nExample 4:\nInput:\u00a058\nOutput: \"LVIII\"\nExplanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\u00a01994\nOutput: \"MCMXCIV\"\nExplanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.\n",

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n\nAny live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.\nAny live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\nAny live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..\nAny dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nWrite a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.\u00a0The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where\u00a0births and deaths occur simultaneously.\nExample:\nInput: \n[\n\u00a0 [0,1,0],\n\u00a0 [0,0,1],\n\u00a0 [1,1,1],\n\u00a0 [0,0,0]\n]\nOutput: \n[\n\u00a0 [0,0,0],\n\u00a0 [1,0,1],\n\u00a0 [0,1,1],\n\u00a0 [0,1,0]\n]\n\nFollow up:\n\nCould you solve it in-place?

(Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.  (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)\n\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.

After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\n\nNote:\nThe length of source is in the range [1, 100].\nThe length of source[i] is in the range [0, 80].\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\nThere are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.\n",

Phone number:\nA phone number is a string consisting of\u00a0only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', '\u00a0'}.\u00a0You may assume a phone\u00a0number contains\u00a010 to 13 digits.\nThe last 10 digits make up the local\u00a0number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that\u00a0the country code is optional.

It is guaranteed that 0 \u2264 Li, Ri \u2264 INT_MAX, 0 < Hi \u2264 INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.\nFor instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .\nThe output is a list of \"key points\" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.\nFor instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].\nNotes:\n\nThe number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].\nThe input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.\nThe output list must be sorted by the x position.\nThere must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]\n\n",

    "Tag Validator": [
        "Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\n\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>. \nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. \n\nValid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: True\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\n\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\n\n\nInvalid Code Examples:\nInput: \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: False\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\nOutput: False\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\n\nInput: \"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\n\nInput: \"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\n\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>\"\nOutput: False\n\n\nNote:\n\nFor simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain letters, digits, '<','>','/','!','[',']' and ' '.\n\n",

        "\nYou are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.\n\nThe syntax for these expressions is given as follows.\n\nAn expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\n\nA let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string \"let\", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.\n\nAn add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\nA mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", or \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.\n\nEvaluation Examples:\nInput: (add 1 2)\nOutput: 3\n\nInput: (mult 3 (add 2 3))\nOutput: 15\n\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x 5))\nOutput: 10\n\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\nInput: (let x 3 x 2 x)\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\nInput: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\nInput: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context\nof the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.\n\nInput: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) \nOutput 4\nExplanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.\n\n\nNote:\nThe given string expression is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\nThe length of expression is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.)\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n",

The number will be represented\u00a0in one of the following three ways:\n\n<IntegerPart> (e.g. 0, 12, 123)\n<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart> \u00a0(e.g. 0.5, 1., 2.12, 2.0001)\n<IntegerPart><.><NonRepeatingPart><(><RepeatingPart><)> (e.g. 0.1(6), 0.9(9), 0.00(1212))\n\nThe repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted within a pair of round brackets.\u00a0 For example:\n1 / 6 = 0.16666666... = 0.1(6) = 0.1666(6) = 0.166(66)\nBoth 0.1(6) or 0.1666(6) or 0.166(66) are correct representations of 1 / 6.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: S = \"0.(52)\", T = \"0.5(25)\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nBecause \"0.(52)\" represents 0.52525252..., and \"0.5(25)\" represents 0.52525252525..... , the strings represent the same number.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: S = \"0.1666(6)\", T = \"0.166(66)\"\nOutput: true\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: S = \"0.9(9)\", T = \"1.\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \n\"0.9(9)\" represents 0.999999999... repeated forever, which equals 1.

A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.\n\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in (A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[2].\n\nWe can't jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\n\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can't jump anymore.\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indexes (i = 1, i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [5,1,3,4,2]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nWe can reach the end from starting indexes 1, 2, and 4.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nNote:\n\n1 <= A.length <= 20000\n0 <= A[i] < 100000\n",

        "Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.\nA Skiplist is a data structure that takes\u00a0O(log(n)) time\u00a0to add, erase and search. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be\u00a0comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.\nFor example:\u00a0we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The\u00a0Skiplist works this way:\n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add\u00a0,\u00a0erase\u00a0and search\u00a0can be faster than O(n).\u00a0It can be proven\u00a0that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\nTo be specific, your design should include these functions:\n\nbool search(int target) : Return whether\u00a0the target exists in the Skiplist\u00a0or not.\nvoid add(int num):\u00a0Insert a value into the SkipList.\u00a0\nbool erase(int num): Remove a value in\u00a0the Skiplist.\u00a0If num\u00a0does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple num values, removing\u00a0any one of them is fine.\n\nSee more about Skiplist :\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.\n\u00a0\nExample:\nSkiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();\n\nskiplist.add(1);\nskiplist.add(2);\nskiplist.add(3);\nskiplist.search(0);   // return false.\nskiplist.add(4);\nskiplist.search(1);   // return true.\nskiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.\nskiplist.erase(1);    // return true.\nskiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n0 <= num, target\u00a0<= 20000\nAt most 50000\u00a0calls will be made to search, add, and erase.\n",

Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.\nReturn the minimum total cost of the\u00a0cuts.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]\nOutput: 16\nExplanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:\n\nThe first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.\nRearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).\nExample 2:\nInput: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]\nOutput: 22\nExplanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.\nThere are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order [4, 6, 5, 2, 1] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.\n\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n <= 10^6\n1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)\n1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1\nAll the integers in cuts\u00a0array are distinct.\n",
