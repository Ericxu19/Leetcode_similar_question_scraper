Now buf = \"abcd\", fp points to 'e'\n    read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf = \"e\", fp points to end of file\n    read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf = \"\", fp points to end of file\n    \n\u00a0\nMethod read:\nBy using the read4 method, implement the method\u00a0read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the\u00a0buffer array\u00a0buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.\nThe return value is the number of actual characters read.\nDefinition of read: \n    Parameters:\tchar[] buf, int n\n        Returns:\tint\n    \n    Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]\n    \n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: file = \"abc\", n = 4\n    Output: 3\n    Explanation:\u00a0After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abc\". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3. Note that \"abc\" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.\n    \nExample 2:\nInput: file = \"abcde\", n = 5\n    Output: 5\n    Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abcde\". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.\n    \nExample 3:\nInput: file = \"abcdABCD1234\", n = 12\n    Output: 12\n    Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abcdABCD1234\". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.\n    \nExample 4:\nInput: file = \"leetcode\", n = 5\n    Output: 5\n    Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"leetc\". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.\n    \n\u00a0\nNote:\n\nConsider that you cannot manipulate the file directly, the file is only accesible for read4 but\u00a0not for read.\nThe read function will only be called once for each test case.\nYou may assume the destination buffer array,\u00a0buf,\u00a0is guaranteed to have enough\u00a0space for storing\u00a0n\u00a0characters.\n\n",

Note that this is just an example, you do not necessarily need to follow this format.\nOr you can follow LeetCode's level order traversal serialization format, where each group of children is separated by the null value.\n\nFor example, the above tree may be serialized as [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14].\nYou do not necessarily need to follow the above suggested formats, there are many more different formats that work so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.\n\u00a0\nConstraints:\n\nThe height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000\nThe total number of nodes is between [0,\u00a010^4]\nDo not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.\n\n",

There is also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls on to the hole.\nGiven the ball position, the hole position and the maze, find out how the ball could drop into the hole by moving the shortest distance. The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the hole (included). Output the moving directions by using 'u', 'd', 'l' and 'r'. Since there could be several different shortest ways, you should output the lexicographically smallest way.

        "\n    LeetCode wants to give one of its best employees the option to travel among N cities to collect algorithm problems. But all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your job is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you could take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\n    \nRules and restrictions:\n\nYou can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.\nThe cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.\nYou totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.\nFor each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.\n\n\nYou're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the maximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.\nExample 1:\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]\n    Output: 12\n    Explanation: Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12. \n    One of the best strategies is:\n    1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day. (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) \n    2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n    3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\n    \n\nExample 2:\nInput:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]\n    Output: 3\n    Explanation: Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. \n    Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks. For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work. So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.\n    \n\nExample 3:\nInput:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]\n    Output: 21\n    Explanation:Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\n    One of the best strategies is:\n    1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. \n    2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n    3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.\n    \n\nNote:\n\nN and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].\nIn the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].\nIn the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].\nYou could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.\nIf you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.\nWe don't consider the impact of flight hours towards the calculation of vacation days.\n\n",

Here are the specific rules:\n\nThe hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.\nThe returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one).

        "Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by\u00a0replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string\u00a0\"aabccc\"\u00a0we replace \"aa\"\u00a0by\u00a0\"a2\"\u00a0and replace \"ccc\"\u00a0by\u00a0\"c3\". Thus the compressed string becomes \"a2bc3\".\nNotice that in this problem, we are not adding\u00a0'1'\u00a0after single characters.\nGiven a\u00a0string s\u00a0and an integer k. You need to delete at most\u00a0k characters from\u00a0s\u00a0such that the run-length encoded version of s\u00a0has minimum length.\nFind the minimum length of the run-length encoded\u00a0version of s after deleting at most k characters.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\nInput: s = \"aaabcccd\", k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us \"a3bc3d\" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = \"abcccd\" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be \"a3c3\" of length 4.\nExample 2:\nInput: s = \"aabbaa\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be \"a4\" of length 2.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: s = \"aaaaaaaaaaa\", k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything.

We want to represent the grid with a Quad-Tree.\nReturn the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.\nNotice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.\nA Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:\n\nval: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's.\u00a0\nisLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.\n\nclass Node {\n    public boolean val;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public boolean isLeaf;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node topLeft;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node topRight;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node bottomLeft;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 public Node bottomRight;\n}\nWe can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:\n\nIf the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's)\u00a0set isLeaf\u00a0True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.\nIf the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and\u00a0set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.\nRecurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the\u00a0wiki.\nQuad-Tree\u00a0format:\nThe output represents the serialized format of a Quad-Tree using level order traversal, where null signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.\nIt is very similar to the serialization of the binary tree. The only difference is that the node is represented as a list [isLeaf, val].\nIf the value of isLeaf or val is True we represent it as 1 in the list\u00a0[isLeaf, val] and if the value of isLeaf or val is False we represent it as 0.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1],[1,0]]\nExplanation: The explanation of this example is shown below:\nNotice that 0 represnts False and 1 represents True in the photo representing the Quad-Tree.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: [[0,1],[1,1],[0,1],[1,1],[1,0],null,null,null,null,[1,0],[1,0],[1,1],[1,1]]\nExplanation: All values in the grid are not the same.

Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.\n\n(An integer could be positive or negative.)\n\nA let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string \"let\", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.\n\nAn add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string \"add\", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\nA mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string \"mult\", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names \"add\", \"let\", or \"mult\" are protected and will never be used as variable names.\n\nFinally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.\n\nEvaluation Examples:\nInput: (add 1 2)\nOutput: 3\n\nInput: (mult 3 (add 2 3))\nOutput: 15\n\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x 5))\nOutput: 10\n\nInput: (let x 2 (mult x (let x 3 y 4 (add x y))))\nOutput: 14\nExplanation: In the expression (add x y), when checking for the value of the variable x,\nwe check from the innermost scope to the outermost in the context of the variable we are trying to evaluate.\nSince x = 3 is found first, the value of x is 3.\n\nInput: (let x 3 x 2 x)\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: Assignment in let statements is processed sequentially.\n\nInput: (let x 1 y 2 x (add x y) (add x y))\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The first (add x y) evaluates as 3, and is assigned to x.\nThe second (add x y) evaluates as 3+2 = 5.\n\nInput: (let x 2 (add (let x 3 (let x 4 x)) x))\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Even though (let x 4 x) has a deeper scope, it is outside the context\nof the final x in the add-expression.  That final x will equal 2.\n\nInput: (let a1 3 b2 (add a1 1) b2) \nOutput 4\nExplanation: Variable names can contain digits after the first character.\n\n\nNote:\nThe given string expression is well formatted: There are no leading or trailing spaces, there is only a single space separating different components of the string, and no space between adjacent parentheses.  The expression is guaranteed to be legal and evaluate to an integer.\nThe length of expression is at most 2000.  (It is also non-empty, as that would not be a legal expression.)\nThe answer and all intermediate calculations of that answer are guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.\n",

(Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.)  To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.  For example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.

After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string \"ab\", which when delimited by newline characters becomes [\"ab\"].\n\n\nNote:\nThe length of source is in the range [1, 100].\nThe length of source[i] is in the range [0, 80].\nEvery open block comment is eventually closed.\nThere are no single-quote, double-quote, or control characters in the source code.\n",

Thus, we return an answer of [2, 5, 5].\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[100, 100], [200, 100]]\nOutput: [100, 100]\nExplanation: Adjacent squares don't get stuck prematurely - only their bottom edge can stick to surfaces.\n\n\u00a0\nNote:\n\n1 <= positions.length <= 1000.\n1 <= positions[i][0] <= 10^8.\n1 <= positions[i][1] <= 10^6.\n\n\u00a0\n",

A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\nExample 1:\nInput: [1,7,4,9,2,5]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].\n\nExample 3:\nInput: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\nOutput: 2\nFollow up:\nCan you do it in O(n) time?\n\n\n",

Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).\n    \nThe geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 \u2264 Li, Ri \u2264 INT_MAX, 0 < Hi \u2264 INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.\nFor instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .\nThe output is a list of \"key points\" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.\nFor instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].\nNotes:\n\nThe number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].\nThe input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.\nThe output list must be sorted by the x position.\nThere must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]\n\n",

From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5].

From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.\nExplanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.\n\n\u00a0\nNotes:\n\nIf the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.\nThe linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.\nYou may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.\nEach value\u00a0on each linked list is in the range [1, 10^9].\nYour code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.\n\n",

Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.\nExample 5:\nInput: \"-91283472332\"\nOutput: -2147483648\nExplanation: The number \"-91283472332\" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\u00a0            Thefore INT_MIN (\u2212231) is returned.\n",
