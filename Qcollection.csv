Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.
Notice that you can assign the value of a node to True or False when isLeaf is False, and both are accepted in the answer.
A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:

val: True if the node represents a grid of 1's or False if the node represents a grid of 0's. 
isLeaf: True if the node is leaf node on the tree or False if the node has the four children.

class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:

If the current grid has the same value (i.e all 1's or all 0's) set isLeaf True and set val to the value of the grid and set the four children to Null and stop.
If the current grid has different values, set isLeaf to False and set val to any value and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the photo.
Recurse for each of the children with the proper sub-grid.


If you want to know more about the Quad-Tree, you can refer to the wiki.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.
Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i. 
A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.","Given an array of unique integers, each integer is strictly greater than 1.

We would like to mask this personal information according to the following rules:

1. Email address:
We define a name to be a string of length ≥ 2 consisting of only lowercase letters a-z or uppercase letters A-Z.
An email address starts with a name, followed by the symbol '@', followed by a name, followed by the dot '.' and followed by a name. 
All email addresses are guaranteed to be valid and in the format of ""name1@name2.name3"".
To mask an email, all names must be converted to lowercase and all letters between the first and last letter of the first name must be replaced by 5 asterisks '*'.

2. Phone number:
A phone number is a string consisting of only the digits 0-9 or the characters from the set {'+', '-', '(', ')', ' '}. You may assume a phone number contains 10 to 13 digits.
The last 10 digits make up the local number, while the digits before those make up the country code. Note that the country code is optional. We want to expose only the last 4 digits and mask all other digits.
The local number should be formatted and masked as ""***-***-1111"", where 1 represents the exposed digits.
To mask a phone number with country code like ""+111 111 111 1111"", we write it in the form ""+***-***-***-1111"".  The '+' sign and the first '-' sign before the local number should only exist if there is a country code.  ","To some string S, we will perform some replacement operations that replace groups of letters with new ones (not necessarily the same size).
Each replacement operation has 3 parameters: a starting index i, a source word x and a target word y.  The rule is that if x starts at position i in the original string S, then we will replace that occurrence of x with y.  If not, we do nothing.","Two images A and B are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)
We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.
(Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)
What is the largest possible overlap?","Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game ""21"".
Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?","There are N dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright.
In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left.
Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

 ","Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.
Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).
    
The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers [Li, Ri, Hi], where Li and Ri are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and Hi is its height. It is guaranteed that 0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX, 0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX, and Ri - Li > 0. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.
For instance, the dimensions of all buildings in Figure A are recorded as: [ [2 9 10], [3 7 15], [5 12 12], [15 20 10], [19 24 8] ] .
The output is a list of ""key points"" (red dots in Figure B) in the format of [ [x1,y1], [x2, y2], [x3, y3], ... ] that uniquely defines a skyline. A key point is the left endpoint of a horizontal line segment. Note that the last key point, where the rightmost building ends, is merely used to mark the termination of the skyline, and always has zero height. Also, the ground in between any two adjacent buildings should be considered part of the skyline contour.
For instance, the skyline in Figure B should be represented as:[ [2 10], [3 15], [7 12], [12 0], [15 10], [20 8], [24, 0] ].
Notes:

The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].
The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.
The output list must be sorted by the x position.
There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]","Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

You are given a string expression representing a Lisp-like expression to return the integer value of.

The syntax for these expressions is given as follows.

An expression is either an integer, a let-expression, an add-expression, a mult-expression, or an assigned variable.  Expressions always evaluate to a single integer.

(An integer could be positive or negative.)

A let-expression takes the form (let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr), where let is always the string ""let"", then there are 1 or more pairs of alternating variables and expressions, meaning that the first variable v1 is assigned the value of the expression e1, the second variable v2 is assigned the value of the expression e2, and so on sequentially; and then the value of this let-expression is the value of the expression expr.

An add-expression takes the form (add e1 e2) where add is always the string ""add"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the addition of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.

A mult-expression takes the form (mult e1 e2) where mult is always the string ""mult"", there are always two expressions e1, e2, and this expression evaluates to the multiplication of the evaluation of e1 and the evaluation of e2.

For the purposes of this question, we will use a smaller subset of variable names.  A variable starts with a lowercase letter, then zero or more lowercase letters or digits.  Additionally for your convenience, the names ""add"", ""let"", or ""mult"" are protected and will never be used as variable names.

Finally, there is the concept of scope.  When an expression of a variable name is evaluated, within the context of that evaluation, the innermost scope (in terms of parentheses) is checked first for the value of that variable, and then outer scopes are checked sequentially.  It is guaranteed that every expression is legal.  Please see the examples for more details on scope.

Evaluation ","In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.
 

0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

 
Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:
 

Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;
When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.

 ","Under a grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words.  Let's use R(expr) to denote the set of words the expression represents.
Grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

Single letters represent a singleton set containing that word.
	
R(""a"") = {""a""}
R(""w"") = {""w""}


When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
	
R(""{a,b,c}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""}
R(""{{a,b},{b,c}}"") = {""a"",""b"",""c""} (notice the final set only contains each word at most once)


When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
	
R(""{a,b}{c,d}"") = {""ac"",""ad"",""bc"",""bd""}
R(""a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}"") = {""abdfg"", ""abdfh"", ""abefg"", ""abefh"", ""acdfg"", ""acdfh"", ""acefg"", ""acefh""}



Formally, the 3 rules for our grammar:

For every lowercase letter x, we have R(x) = {x}
For expressions e_1, e_2, ... , e_k with k >= 2, we have R({e_1,e_2,...}) = R(e_1) ∪ R(e_2) ∪ ...
For expressions e_1 and e_2, we have R(e_1 + e_2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e_1) × R(e_2)}, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.
